	//! @details
	//! This callback is invoked asynchronously when a connected client tries
	//! to signal end of session and that client has no more data to send.
	//!
	//! When this callback is invoked, the connection should be at half-closed
	//! state. There should be no data remaining to be received. Hence, 
	//! OnReceiveData will no longer be called for this connection.
	//!
	//! To perform a graceful shutdown, perform the following.
	//! 1. Send all the data that you need to send. It is not required to
	//! send all remaining data within this callback. The connection will 
	//! remain in half-closed state as long as the connected client also
	//! wish to perform graceful shutdown.
	//!
	//! 2. Once all remaining data are sent, Call 
	//! CIocpServer.Shutdown(cid, SD_SEND) to close the other half of
	//! of the connection.
	//!
	//! 3. Finally, call CIocpServer.Disconnect(cid) to fully close the socket. 
	//! After this, the OnDisconnect callback will be asynchronously called 
	//! through one of the IOCP thread. The connection is then fully 
	//! terminated.
	//! 
	//! @param[in] cid
	//! A unique Id that represents the connection. 
	//! This is the unique key that may be used for bookkeeping, and will remain

	//! may or may not be your main thread's context.
	//!
	//! If this function is not overridden, the default behavior is to 
	//! immediately close the other half of the socket, and fully close the
	//! connection.	After this, the OnDisconnect callback will be called 
	//! through one of the IOCP thread. The connection is fully terminated.
